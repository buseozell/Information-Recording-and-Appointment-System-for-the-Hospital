## Appointment and Information Recording System for Hospitals

This project that I coded through Eclipse is my second project.

Patients can see general information about the doctors they want to make an appointment with and can create their own appointments; staff 
can see patient information, staff information and work schedules if there is a new patient record; In addition, a system was designed where doctors can make changes 
on recorded patient information. </br> An online English presentation was made with the planning of the project, drawing the UML activity and class diagrams, writing the pseudo 
code and creating the codes using the java software language. This work, in which I also acted as the spokesperson of the project, is a team work consisting of two people.

Project details are available in the reports. You can access the code source from the "AppointmentAndInformationRecordingSystemForHospital" file. 
I added the images and Excel/Word forms I used in the project to the "Images&Files" folder. </br>
I leave the link of the presentation video below. </br>
